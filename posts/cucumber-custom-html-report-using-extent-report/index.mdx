title: 'Cucumber custom html report using Extent Report'

This was the one long pending post that I wanted to share with you all. I would like to share my happiness that my first open source java library got published in Apache Maven to generate the custom report for Cucumber using Extent report.

My main goal was to create a custom report for the cucumber-jvm. But I don't want to invest time in reinventing or developing htmls. I was searching for the library which can easily produce me the nice report with more details.

Then I found the <a href="http://extentreports.relevantcodes.com/" target="_blank">ExtentReports</a> authored by Anshoo Arora. There are many posts covering on how to use this library in your TestNG tests as a listener. However we always missed on how to use this in cucumber-jvm. Hence the <a href="https://github.com/email2vimalraj/CucumberExtentReporter" target="_blank">cucumber-extentsreport</a> library evolved. Let's see the action part before you think I'm boring you.

I've created a new page for updates about this plugin. Kindly refer the page on how to use this library here:Â <a href="http://www.vimalselvam.com/cucumber-extent-reporter/">Cucumber Extent Reporter</a>.
