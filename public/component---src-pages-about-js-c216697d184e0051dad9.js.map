Writing code excited me.\n        Building UI's gave me the feel of a creator. I took to exploring UI a\n        bit more seriously.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        My work took me through some interesting turns and in the process, I\n        learnt automation as well. Worked on building some automation frameworks\n        in Java for a brief stint.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        But my love for UI never vanished. Eventually I have now evolved into\n        what the industry calls as a \"Full stack developer\".\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I specialize in different technologies like Javascript, Java, Python\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        At work, I am involved in building reliability/monitoring systems. For\n        building them I get to play with Kafka, Prometheus, Bosun, OpenTSDB,\n        M3Db, Redis, MySQL, MongoDb, Golang, GraphQL, Spark, Hadoop Clusters and\n        so on.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I have discovered a new found love for Open source and web development.\n        I am a Selenium and Appium enthusiast and try to chime in occasionally\n        into TestNG as well through bug fixes.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        At home, when personal life gives me some free time, I work on building\n        my own pet projects that I open source to the community.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This site is all about sharing what I have learnt. You will get to hear\n        about things that made me curious, some nifty hacks that I learnt to do\n        some stuff (or) at other times, all those things I learnt the hard way\n        by making mistakes.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>My intent is to share my learnings and learn from others as well.</p>\n\n      <p>\n        My sincere hope is that my posts helps you in some way or the other.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        If you would like to share some feedback, or want me to write about\n        something that you feel is important, please do reach out to me.
